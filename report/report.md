# Introduction

## Background

**TODO** The problem at hand has a small number of data points.

### Format of the data

The data was labelled.

**TODO** The number of attributes (3 continuous and the rest binary refers to...) describes...

# Methodology

## Plan

### Tree based

Decision tree, Random Forest or Boost tree
It might be a binary decision tree because of the duality of the classification

- Each node represents an attribute
- Examples to work from: Lab 1, Lab 2 and lab 4
- From Introduction to Machine Learning textbook Nilsson
  > For categorical and numeric attributes, wemust also decide what the tests should be (besides selecting the order). Severaltechniques have been tried; the most popular one is at each stage to select thattest that maximally reduces an entropy-like measure

### ANN

- Examples to work from: Lab 4

### Bayesian

If assuming or willing to assume the attributes are independent and normally distributed.

### Method selection

Comparison of the methods:

## Data splitting

The data was split into various proportions for training and testing. These proportions were adjusted in 10% intervals to observe the change in accuracy of the system.

There were a total of 2359 data points, of which 1978 were nonads and 381 were ads. **TODO** The proportion of this data maintained when splicing the data for training and testing, and the data was selected randomly.
